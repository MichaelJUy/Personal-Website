                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> I am a <em>"mature"</em> student currently studying <strong>Computer Information Technology</strong> at B.C.I.T. 
                    I have been on and off studying at BCIT since 2004. The first program I enrolled at BCIT was to study <b>Electronics Technician Common Core</b>. 
                    I left after a year and took a break from university life for a few years. I then enrolled at Kwantlen Polytechnic University to study in the 
                    <b>Computer Information Systems</b>. However, after a few years i decided to quit and go back to taking high school courses. 
                    After finishing more high school courses, I enrolled at BCIT for the <b>Mechanical Engineering Program</b> 
                    I was able to get in with even advance admissions and I was proud of myself. 
                    A year later I decided to quit and pursue the <b>Financial Management Program</b> at BCIT and I survived for a few years but I was not able to finish. 
                    I decided to take a long break from BCIT and I got a job at <b>CIBC</b>and stayed for 5 years. After years of working, I decided to go back to BCIT to study 
                    <b>Business Information Technology Managemnent</b> because it was the first program that is involved in Artificial Intelligence.
                    I was in the program until last May. Over the course of Summer 2022, I decided to go back to my routes of studying computers cause I love using computers and I enjoy troubleshooting and helping others with computer problems.
