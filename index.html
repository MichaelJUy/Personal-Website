        <p> I am a <em>"mature"</em> student currently studying <strong>Computer Information Technology</strong> at B.C.I.T. 
            I have been on and off studying at BCIT since I graduated high school in 2004. When I got out of high school, I enrolled at BCIT to study <b>Electronics Technician Common Core</b> because of my parents. 
            I left after a year and took a break from university life for a few years. I then enrolled at Kwantlen Polytechnic University to study in the <b>Computer Information Systems</b>. 
            However, after a few years i decided to quit and go back to taking high school courses. After finishing more high school courses, I enrolled at BCIT for the <b>Mechanical Engineering Program</b> 
            I was able to get in with even advance admissions and I was proud of myself. A year later I decided to quit and pursue the <b>Financial Management Program</b> at BCIT and I survived for a few years but I was not able to finish. 
            I decided to take a long break from BCIT and I got a job at <b>CIBC</b>and stayed for 5 years. 
            After years of working, I decided to go back to BCIT to study <b>Business Information Technology Managemnent</b> because it was the first program that is involved in Artificial Intelligence.
            I was in the program until last May. 
            Over the course of Summer 2022, I decided to go back to my routes of studying computers cause I love using computers and I enjoy troubleshooting and helping others with computer problems.
